That electrical signal is translated to a pressure reading on the gauge on the dash of your car. It is mounted on the outside of the engine block and connected by a drilled passage to the pressurize oil gallery ( a fancy name for the main oil passage ) so that the sensor reads the pressure in the gallery directly. If a sensor leaks it will cause oil to drip on the ground but this is a very rare thing.\"]])\r\n",
